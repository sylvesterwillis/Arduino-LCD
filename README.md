The wiring to the Arduino is listed below.

PIN# = Connection Needed
1    = tie to gnd
2    = tie to 5v
3    = resistor ~2-3K to gnd
4    = rs = tie to pin 12 on arduino
5    = r/w = tie to gnd
6    = enable = tie to pin 11 on arduino
7-10 = open (no connections)
11   = tie to pin 5 on arduino
12   = tie to pin 4 on arduino
13   = tie to pin 3 on arduino
14   = tie to pin 2 on arduino
15   = tie to 4.2 V (5V is working for me right now)
16   = tie to gnd
